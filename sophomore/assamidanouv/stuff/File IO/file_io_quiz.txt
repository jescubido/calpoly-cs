File IO Quiz

You can use any references you want for this quiz including code you have written. 
You may also test code in IDLE. Work in groups of up to three students. This is a
20-point minor assessment.

1. What import statement is needed to read and write files in Python?

    a. import file
    b. import io
    c. import file_io
    d. no imports are needed
	
2. Consider a game where map data is stored as plain text. Which of the
   following statements would create an open file object f referencing a
   data file called "map_data.txt"?

    a. f = open('map_data.txt', 'r')
    b. open.f("map_data.txt", 'r')
    c. f = "map_data.txt".open('r')
    d. set f to ("map_data.txt").open() as 'r'
	
3. Modes for opening files include 'w', 'r', 'r+', and 'a'. Of these, which
   allow for reading of the files contents? Check all that apply.

    a. [ ] w		b. [ ] r		c. [ ] r+		d. [ ] a
	
4. Modes for opening files include 'w', 'r', 'r+', and 'a'. Of these, which
   allow for writing to the file? Check all that apply.

    a. [ ] w		b. [ ] r		c. [ ] r+		d. [ ] a

	
5. It is possible to open a file without specifing a mode. Which mode is
   used by default when no mode is specified?

    a. w		b. r		c. r+		c. a
	
6. Consider opening a file called 'preferences.txt' in mode 'w', which of
   the following are true? Check all that apply.

    [ ] a. If the file 'preferences.txt' does not exist, a runtime error will
           result causing the program to crash.
    [ ] b. If the file 'preferences.txt' does not exist, a file with that name
           will be created.
    [ ] c. If the file 'preferences.txt' already exists, then data written to
           the file will overwrite previously saved data.
    [ ] d. If the file 'preferences.txt' already exists, then data written to
           the file will be appended to the end of previously saved data.	
		
		
7. Which statement will store the contents of the map file opened above into
   a string variable m?

    a. m = read('f')
    b. m = read(f)
    c. m = f.read()
    d. m = import(f)

8. Consider another multiple-line file listing player data with each piece of
   data on a separate line. (Perhaps name, level, health, location, etc.)
   Assume in the program it is desired to read each line into a List. Which
   code block will correctly read the data? 

    a. with file('player_data.txt') as f:
           data = f.read().splitlines()

    b. with open('player_data.txt') as f:
           data = f.read().split()

    c. with open('player_data.txt') as f:
           data = f.read().splitlines()

    d. with file('player_data.txt') as f:
           data = f.readlines()

9. How is a newline character represented in plaintext?

    a. /n
    b. \n
    c. \l
    d. /l

10. Which statement correctly closes an open file object f?

    a. close(f)
    b. f.close
    c. f.close()
    d. close('f')

11. Files opened using 'with' are automatically closed, so no close statement
    is required.

    a. True
    b. False


	
	
	
	
	
	
Copy the files 'io_quiz.py' and 'scrabble_list.txt' fromt he common. scrabble_list.txt
contains a list of all valid words in the game of Scrabble. The file is too long to inspect 
visually, so you'll need to write a program to process the data to answer some of 
the following questions.

12. Write a block of code that opens the file and stores each line as an item
    in a List called words.

13. Write a statement that prints the total number of elements in words.

14. Write statement that prints the first 10 elements in words.


Problems 15 & 16 are 3 points each. You can get partial credit for non-working
code, so print your code even if you cannot find the answers to these questions.

15. How many Scrabble words do not contain the letters 'e'?

    Hint: You'll need to use a for loop to check each element in words. Each
	      time you find a word without an 'e', increase a count variable.
	
	
16. Create a new file with only words that both begin and end with the
    same letter. Be sure that each word appears on a new line in your text
	file.


Print the code you wrote to answer questions 12-16 and staple it to the back
of this quiz. Use comments (#12, #13, ...) to identify which code block is
used to answer each question. Also print the first page of the text file you
created to answer #16.
