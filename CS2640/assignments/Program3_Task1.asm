# Due Date: 05/07/2023
# Objective:
# Write an Assembly program that will return a letter grade for each element in an array 
# - (e.g. test scores in an array of scores)

# Use the following scores array data in your program:
# int scores = [32, 56, 78, 66, 88, 90, 93, 100, 101, 82]

# Include the following in your program:
# - a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
# - a loop counter
# - a separate case for grades above 100 (i.e. prints out "A with Extra Credit")
# - your name printed out after all the grades are read (and before the program exits)

#print corresponding letter grade
.macro letterGrade(%x)
	li $v0, 4
	la $a0, %x
	syscall
	
	j increment
.end_macro 

# display specified prompt to user 
.macro display(%x)
	li $v0, 4
	la $a0, %x
	syscall 
.end_macro 

.data
intScores: .word 32, 56, 78, 66, 88, 90, 93, 100, 101, 82
prompt1: .asciiz "\nThe grade for "
prompt2: .asciiz " is: "
exitPrompt: .asciiz "\nName: Friendly Assembly\nThe program will now exit."

#letter grade values for user display
letterA: .asciiz "A"
letterB: .asciiz "B"
letterC: .asciiz "C"
letterD: .asciiz "D"
letterF: .asciiz "F"
extraCreditA: .asciiz "A with extra credit"
