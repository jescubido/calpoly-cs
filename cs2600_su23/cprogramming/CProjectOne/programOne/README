Write a C program that canopen and read any user provided
text file (Ask user for file name). If you wish, you may read
the file line by line or character by character. Then print out
the number of occurrences of each of the vowels a, e, i, o and
u in the text, the total number of consonants, the total
number of puncuations and then print out each of these
items as a % of the total number of characters in the files
(ignore blank spaces and any new line characters). Also output
these values into a file called output.txt. Desired output
format is as follows (the numbers in the output below are
just being used as an example):

Percentages of various characters:

a 10%; e 4%; i 3%; o 4%; u 0%; consonants 67%; punct 12%
