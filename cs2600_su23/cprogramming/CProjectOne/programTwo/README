Write a C program that creates a structure called matrix.
The members of this structure are a float pointer to pointer for
creating a 2D array, and two integers that are the number of rows
and columns of this matrix.

struct matrix {
float **m; // pointer to a pointer for storing the 2D array
int m,n // m rows and n columns

}

The program should allow the user to enter the size and elements of the two matrices in
this format. e.g. if the size entered by the user is 2x3 (2 rows and 3 columns), the 6
elements can be entered row wise in a single line like this:

1 4 -5 4 2 0

this is the matrix	1 4 -5
			4 2 0

Have the users enter two matrices and write a function that takes these matrices and
returns the multiplication of these two matrices. Print out the resulting matrix in the
main() program. Please make sure that the matrices have the correct size to be able to
multiply them. The function prototype will look like this:

matrix multiply(matrix, matrix);
